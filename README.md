# Project

A full-stack application with a backend API (REST + GraphQL) and a frontend client.

## Documentation

- [Getting Started](docs/guides/getting-started.md)
- [Backend Service Map](backend/docs/service-map.md)
- [API Reference](docs/api/README.md) — external REST/GraphQL reference, versioning and deprecation policy
- [Contracts](contracts/README.md)

## API Reference

The external API reference for the backend REST and GraphQL endpoints is published under [`docs/api/`](docs/api/README.md). It is generated from the existing backend route and schema definitions and includes the versioning and deprecation policy for external consumers.

## Repository Layout

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Stellar-Save system consists of four main layers that work together to provide a decentralized ROSCA experience:

![Stellar-Save Architecture](docs/architecture-diagram.svg)

### Architecture Components

- **User Layer**: Users interact with the system through Stellar wallets (Freighter, Lobstr, Albedo)
- **Frontend Layer**: React + TypeScript SPA with Vite, Material-UI components, and React Query for state management
- **Blockchain Layer**: Stellar network with Soroban smart contracts managing groups, contributions, and payouts
- **Data Layer**: On-chain storage, Stellar Horizon API for transaction history, and Soroban events for real-time updates

### Key Data Flows

1. **Group Creation**: User → Frontend → Contract → On-chain Storage → Events → UI Update
2. **Contribution**: User → Frontend → Contract → Escrow → Storage → Events → UI Update
3. **Payout**: User → Frontend → Contract → Escrow → Recipient → Storage → Events → UI Update

For detailed architecture documentation, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## 🚀 Features

- **Create Groups**: Set contribution amount, cycle duration, and max members
- **Join & Participate**: Members join and contribute each cycle
- **Automatic Payouts**: When all members contribute, payout executes automatically to the next recipient
- **Native XLM Support**: Built-in support for Stellar Lumens (XLM)
- **Token Ready**: Architecture supports custom Stellar tokens (roadmap item)
- **Transparent**: All contributions and payouts are verifiable on-chain

## 🛠️ Quick Start & Workspace Guides

To get started quickly, follow the dedicated setup guides for each component of the Stellar-Save monorepo:

- 🚀 **Smart Contracts**: See [contracts/stellar-save/src/lib.rs](contracts/stellar-save/src/lib.rs) and the [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for smart contract API documentation.
- 💻 **Frontend Web App**: See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for React/TypeScript setup, environment configuration (`VITE_*`), MUI theme tokens, and local development commands.
- 📱 **Mobile Application**: See [mobile/README.md](mobile/README.md) for Expo React Native setup, iOS/Android emulator instructions, and mobile architecture.
- 🛠️ **Scripts & Tooling**: See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for build (`build.sh`), test (`test.sh`), and deployment (`deploy_testnet.sh`, `deploy_mainnet.sh`) scripts.
- ⚙️ **Backend Service**: See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for server setup, environment variables schema, and indexer configuration.

### Common Development Commands

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Xoulomon/Stellar-Save.git
cd Stellar-Save

# Install root dependencies & git hooks
npm install

# Build Soroban smart contracts
./scripts/build.sh

# Run all test suites across smart contracts and web frontend
./scripts/test.sh
```

### Run Demo

Follow the step-by-step guide in [demo/demo-script.md](demo/demo-script.md).

## 🎓 Smart Contract API

### Group Management
```rust
create_group(contribution_amount, cycle_duration, max_members) -> u64
get_group(group_id) -> Group
list_members(group_id) -> Vec<Address>
```

### Membership
```rust
join_group(group_id)
is_member(group_id, address) -> bool
```

### Contributions
```rust
contribute(group_id, member, amount)
get_contribution_status(group_id, cycle_number) -> Vec<(Address, bool)>
```

### Payouts
```rust
execute_payout(group_id)
is_complete(group_id) -> bool
```

### Emergency Pause
```rust
pause_group(group_id, caller)    // Creator-only: halt contributions & payouts
unpause_group(group_id, caller)  // Creator-only: resume contributions & payouts
```

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Group creation and configuration
- ✅ Member joining and validation
- ✅ Contribution flow and tracking
- ✅ Payout rotation and distribution
- ✅ Group completion lifecycle
- ✅ Emergency pause/unpause scenarios
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

Run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

### Test Coverage

Coverage is tracked and enforced per workspace and published to
[Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Xoulomon/Stellar-Save), which provides public
reports and historical trends.

| Workspace  | Tool             | Minimum coverage gate |
|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| frontend   | vitest (v8)      | 80% lines / 70% branches |
| contracts  | cargo-tarpaulin  | 85% lines |
| backend    | jest (ts-jest)   | 60% lines |

PRs **cannot merge** if coverage falls below these targets or drops versus the
base commit: the `coverage.yml` workflow uploads results to Codecov on every
push and pull request, and the Codecov project/patch status checks (configured
in [`codecov.yml`](./codecov.yml)) act as required PR merge gates. The same
thresholds also fail CI locally via per-tool gates (tarpaulin `fail-under`,
vitest `coverage.thresholds`, jest `coverageThreshold`).

Run coverage locally:
```bash
# contracts
cargo tarpaulin --config tarpaulin.toml
# frontend
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
# backend
cd backend && npm run test:coverage
```

See [docs/test-coverage.md](docs/test-coverage.md) for full details.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

**Financial Inclusion**: Over 1.7 billion adults globally are unbanked. Ajo/Esusu has served African communities for generations as a trusted savings mechanism.

**Blockchain Benefits**:
- No need for a trusted coordinator
- Transparent contribution and payout history
- Programmable rules enforced by smart contracts
- Accessible to anyone with a Stellar wallet

**Target Users**:
- African diaspora communities
- Unbanked/underbanked populations
- Small business owners needing working capital
- Communities building financial discipline


## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **v1.0** (Current): XLM-only groups, basic functionality
- **v1.1**: Custom token support (USDC, EURC, etc.)
- **v2.0**: Flexible payout schedules, penalty mechanisms
- **v3.0**: Frontend UI with wallet integration
- **v4.0**: Mobile app, fiat on/off-ramps

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for details.
