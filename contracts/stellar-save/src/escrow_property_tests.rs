/// Property-based tests for escrow invariants.
///
/// Feature: Escrow
///
/// Core invariants tested:
///   1. No double-credit — a member cannot be credited more than once per cycle.
///   2. Conservation of credited amounts — the sum of all credited amounts
///      across all cycles equals the expected total derived from the per-cycle
///      credit amount and the number of cycles, with no loss or gain.
///   3. Solvency & Non-negativity — at no point in arbitrary sequences of deposits
///      and partial withdrawals does escrow balance drop below zero.
///   4. Concurrent Interleaving Conservation — the aggregate escrow balance matches
///      total deposited minus total withdrawn across arbitrary interleaved member actions.
///   5. Exhaustive Withdrawal Liquidation — draining remaining balances brings balance to exactly 0.
///   6. Overdraw Protection — any partial withdrawal exceeding available member credit is rejected.
///   7. Member Account Isolation — member operations do not perturb independent member balances.
///   8. Multi-Cycle Interleaving — partial refunds in past cycles do not corrupt subsequent cycles.
///
/// # Gap Analysis (Issue #1714)
/// Prior to this enhancement, `escrow_property_tests.rs` only evaluated static record data
/// consistency and complete ROSCA rotation conservation (Properties 1–7). It lacked coverage for:
/// - Dynamic state tracking: simulation of active escrow accounts holding deposits.
/// - Partial withdrawals: members withdrawing fractions of their credited balances.
/// - Concurrent contribution interleavings: sequences where deposits from member A interleave
///   with partial withdrawals or refunds by member B.
/// - Solvency & overdraw invariants: ensuring that an attempted withdrawal exceeding credited funds
///   is rejected without mutating state or corrupting system solvency.
/// - Liquidation soundness: ensuring complete withdrawal drains the escrow exactly to zero.
